# regression_tables_and_graphs
A Python tutorial program that shows how to organize regression results into a DataFrame, then plot both the dependent variable values (as a grouped line chart) and the regression coefficients (as a grouped bar chart)

For a discussion of this program, please see my blog post [link forthcoming].
